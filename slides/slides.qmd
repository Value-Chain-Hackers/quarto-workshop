::: notes
He uses Python and I love using R and we both work together. It is partially because of that that we decided to explore using quarto in our Data Science and Data Visualisation classes. This workshop is, then, an excuse to force us using it and learn by doing.

## About you {background-color="black" background-image="https://healthyschoolspa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Kids-in-Class.jpeg" background-opacity="0.5"}

Let us know about your **prior knowledge about quarto**

1. Experts
2. Some degree of knowledge
3. Never used before, but I know what it is
3. I do not know what it is

. . .

About your **preferred programming language**:

* R [| Python]{.fragment} [| Julia]{.fragment}  

. . . 

About **this workshop**: Have you had time to read cases' descriptions?

::: aside

Usually, we'd be asking you to introduce yourselves, but given the large number of attendees, we have done that via [this github issue](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/issues/17){style="color:white!important;text-decoration:underline"}.

**About us**

We are not Quarto experts!

We are not affiliated in any way to Quarto or Posit. We do not have any commercial interest.

We are just quarto users who want to share our progress and engage with other users in a co-creation process with an attitude of *healthy skepticism*.

. . .

**About the session**

This is not (just) a talk about quarto. Others have done it very well before[^1]. We will be presenting quarto's main claims and putting them to a test (with your help).

. . .

**About the slides**

These slides have been created with quarto (of course!)

[^1]: See references' section


# Quarto {background-color="#2780e3"}

A brief overview to quarto 

[(that's why we are here, right?)]{.smaller}

## Preamble

-   Agreement on importance of Literate programming (concept) and notebooks (artifacts)
-   Lots of different solutions, mostly language specific

. . .

::: columns 
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R: Rmarkdown

-   Markdown with configurable code blocks
-   Focus on R (but does support other languages [see here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html))
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   natively
    -   bookdown, blogdown, ...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Python: Jupyter notebook

-   Single `JSON` file containing code, text and output
-   Kernels for many programming languages
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   Jupyter book, nbconvert, ...
:::
:::

. . .

This might be about to change with quarto

::: notes

But before actually speaking about quarto, we wanted to highlight two items.

first, the shared agreement in the DS community about the importance of literate programming ...

And second, that the way this has been approached greatly differs based on the programming language you may be using.



:::

## What's quarto?

According to their creators[^development] ([Posit](https://posit.co/) -formerly RStudio)): 

-   "Open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc" - [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)
-   "Code output via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable" - [GitHub Repo](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/)


. . . 

From a technical standpoint (Adapted from [Mock, 2022](https://jthomasmock.github.io/quarto-2hr-webinar/materials/01-intro-quarto.html#/so-what-is-quarto)):

> Quarto is a **command line interface** (CLI) [that **renders** mixed-format files (`.ipynb`/Jupyter notebook) OR plain text files (`.qmd`, `.rmd`, `.md`)]{.fragment} [into different **outputs** (reports, books, websites, presentations...)]{.fragment} [, which can be in different **formats** (PDF/Word/HTML...) .]{.fragment} 

[^development]: Development started in January 2021 and is under heavy development (weekly releases)


::: notes

So, what's quarto, then?

According to Posit (formerly known as Rstudio), the creators of quarto, quarto is the next generation of Rmarkdown...

Ok, this is how quarto is marketed, but this may not be clear to most of us, so we tried to define it from a more technical point of view.

Adapting from Mock, quarto is...

## Air Quality

@fig-airquality further explores the impact of temperature 
    on ozone level.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-airquality

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(airquality, aes(Temp, Ozone)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "loess"
)

* Frontmatter defintions
* Content
    * Text (Markdown with batteries)
    * Code blocks

... to its output.

In this case, an **html document** (line 6) with text, code (folded -see line 9) and output.
:::
:::

Does this look familiar to you?

::: notes

We've seen what quarto is, so now let's focus on how it does its thing.

At this point, if there's someone who has used Rmd before may be thinking. But Carlos, you've jjust defined how rmd works!

And aside from minor changes in the frontmatter, that's true

So probably the next slide will bring some light on the differences

:::

## How does it work?

This is what happens behind the scenes for single file documents:

Not comprehensive (i.e. does not include projects, bibliographical references and cross-references -tables, figures, chapters-, add custom css, including files within files...)

## Key features {background-color="rgb(236, 248, 232)" .smaller}
 
-   Language agnostic (Works with `R`, `Python`, `Julia`, `Observable`):
    -   Can combine different languages in a single document
    -   Same syntax
    -   One command line

. . . 

-   IDE Agnostic (Integrations - see [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/))
    -   RStudio
    -   Visual Studio Code/VS Codium
    -   Jupyter

. . . 

-   Diverse outputs
    -   Formats: `pdf`, `html`, `epub`, `docx`...
    -   Media: articles, presentations (like this one!), blogs, websites, books...
-   Sensible defaults
    -   Bootstrap


## Key features {background-color="rgb(255, 241, 232)"}

Most of the "not so great" features derive from being under heavy development:

-   New features to come (to be at par with knitr and to surpass it)
    - No new features added to `Rmarkdown`[^rmd]
-   Not as mature as other solutions
-   Weekly releases 
    - Different versions, different results

[^rmd]: For more info about replacing Rmarkdown with quarto, you can refer to [these FAQs on quarto's webiste](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/rmarkdown.html) and Yihui Xie’s blog post [With Quarto Coming, is R Markdown Going Away? No](https://yihui.org/en/2022/04/quarto-r-markdown/)
