::: notes
He uses Python and I love using R and we both work together. It is partially because of that that we decided to explore using quarto in our Data Science and Data Visualisation classes. This workshop is, then, an excuse to force us using it and learn by doing.

**About us**

We are not Quarto experts!

We are not affiliated in any way to Quarto or Posit. We do not have any commercial interest.

We are just quarto users who want to share our progress and engage with other users in a co-creation process with an attitude of *healthy skepticism*.

. . .

**About the session**

This is not (just) a talk about quarto. Others have done it very well before[^1]. We will be presenting quarto's main claims and seeing how it compares to other alternatives.

[^1]: See references' section

## Introduce yourselves! {background-color="black" background-image="https://images.unsplash.com/flagged/photo-1580139624070-910f651c1b78?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80" background-opacity="0.6"}

Keep it short, please![^2]

[^2]: We'll have plenty of time to getting to know each other

## Preamble

-   Literate programming is important
-   Lots of different solutions, some are language specific

. . .

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### R: Rmarkdown

-   Markdown with configurable code blocks
-   Focus on R (but does support other languages [see here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html))
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   natively
    -   bookdown, blogdown, ...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Python: Jupyter notebook

-   Single `JSON` file containing code, text and output
-   Kernels for many programming languages
-   Can compile to other formats:
    -   Jupyter book, nbconvert, ...

## About quarto

-   "Open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc" - [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)
-   Developed by [Posit](https://posit.co/) (RStudio) as Rmarkdown's next generation. "Code output via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable" - [GitHub Repo](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/)
-   Batteries included ("articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more") - [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)
-   Code chunks in .qmd markdown files are evaluated by the language engine, and the document is built using Pandoc with reasonable default formatting

## Rmarkdown's next generation

-   One `qmd` file -\> parser -\> one or more outputs
-   2 files:
    -   `qmd` containing the "source" (configuration, text and code)
    -   `*` containing the output (`pdf`, `html`, `docx`...)
-   Syntax:
    -   Config: yaml, metadata
    -   Rich text: markdown on steroids (variable text -inline code-, callouts, mermaid diagrams...)
    -   Code: code blocks (they can have special comments for configs, )
-   One `qmd` file, one or more outputs

## Features: Programming languages

-   Works with `R`, `Python`, `Julia`, `Observable`
    -   Can combine different languages in a single document

## Features: Integrations

-   [getting started](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
    -   RStudio
    -   Visual Studio Code/VS Codium
    -   Jupyter

## Features: Outputs

-   Diverse outputs
    -   Formats: `pdf`, `html`, `epub`, `docx`...
    -   Media: articles, presentations (like this one!), blogs, websites, books...

## Features: Authoring

-   Authoring tools: scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, bibliographical references, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.

. . .

-   File format `qmd` is a text file that doesn't include output. Human readable and good for version control.

## About Quarto

A brief introduction...

Possible outline:

1.  What's quarto
2.  What can we do with it?
3.  How does it work?

# Use cases {background-color="#552D62"}

## Overview

1.  Pick a case [from the list](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/labels/cases) you would like to develop during this workshop
2.  Create groups of people who want to work on the same case and assign roles:
3.  Work on your case and **document your progress**!

::: aside

This assumes you have already:

1. Installed quarto in your machine (instructions here)
2. read the case studies and you have a preference for at least one of them)

:::

## Use cases and groups creation {background-image="https://www.mediatwo.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/282568_x-marks-the-spot-png-1024x404.png" background-size="contain" background-opacity="0.1"}

1. There's a designated areas for every use case
2. Move to the designated area, according to the use case you'd like to work on
3. Meet and greet
4. Assign roles:
    1. Documentator(s) (at least one person)
    2. Spokesperson/representative (one person, only)

::: aside
This assumes you have already read the case studies and you have a preference for at least one of them.

If you haven't, please join one of the existing groups (or create a new one) whenever you're ready.
:::

## Work on your case


1. Install quarto's binaries: <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
2. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/)
3. Create a new folder for your case under `cases/`
4. Copy the template from  `cases/template/documentation_template.qmd `  to your folder, which will be used to document the process
5. Make any changes needed
6. Commit any changes
7. Submit Pull Request to the [Workshop's GitHub repo](https://github.com/WarwickCIM/quarto-workshop/)

# Discussion

Some ideas (but feel free to add yours!):

-   How mature is quarto to you?

-   Do you see yourself using quarto? In which context(s)?

-   Do you see quarto replacing your current toolkit?

-   What's missing in Quarto? (i.e mybinder?)

-   Quarto, compared to

    -   Other formats: Format `*.qmd` (code) + output vs `*.ipynb` (json with output)

    -   Other tools (i.e. jupyterbook, bookdown..., distill)

# What's next? {background-color="#552D62"}

If you've enjoyed the workshop and want to keep exploring quarto, there are some things that can be done:

- Tell us how we did (fill in this form)
- Keep in touch with us!
- Keep extending the use cases and convert this into a repository for quarto use cases
- ...
